# Additional Notes
- Currently limited to 1000 products. If you have more than 1000 products in your catalog, you will need to customize code on your end.
- Note that the above instructions are to create a new page and add liquid code. These instructions will create a public live page which most of you probably don't want to showcase to the world so you will have to add a password to it or use the liquid in this repo to do it in your own protected way.
- QR Code generated is using google charts api.
- All code and instructions are as is. By reading this repository, readme or any code, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your own doings.
